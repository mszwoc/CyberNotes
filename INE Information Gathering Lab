This exercise will help you understand how to perform DNS enumeration and find misconfiguration flaws using various tools.

Lab Environment
In this lab environment, the user will access a Kali GUI instance.

The target server, as described below, is running a DNS server. DNS zone transfer is enabled on the server.

DNS Server
witrap.com

Your Kali has an interface with IP address 192.X.Y.Z. Run "IP addr" to know the values of X and Y.

Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.X.Y.1

Note: Please make sure to specify the target DNS server (192.X.Y.3) while making the DNS queries/requests. This server is NOT configured in the attacker machine. Hence, we need to specify it explicitly.

Objective: Enumerate the DNS server and answer the five given questions.


Tools
The best tools for this lab are:

Nmap
dig
nslookup
Please go ahead ONLY if you have COMPLETED the lab or you are stuck! Checking the solutions before actually trying the concepts and techniques you studied in the course will dramatically reduce the benefits of a hands-on lab!


Answers:

I started by doing an nmap scan of 192.156.207.3. This IP was given to us so there was no need to scan entire subnets.

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-05-22 04:11 IST

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.23 seconds

Port tcp/53 is open, so I know that I have the correct target, and that the target is live.

From a different lab I know that you can use dig to initiate a zone transfer using
dig @<dns-server-ip> <dns-server-name> -t AXFR +nocookie
We are given the dns-server-name of witrap.com

AXFR is of course the DNS Zone Transfer Protocol

dig @192.156.207.3 witrap.com -t AXFR +nocookie
